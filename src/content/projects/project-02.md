  ## Minimalism With Warmth  
  A wellness brand’s first studio space needed to feel grounded and bright. We leaned into natural materials, soft curves, and tonal layering.

  Acoustic panels and smart zoning made the space feel calm and focused without sacrificing style.

  ## What We Did  
  - Commercial Interior Design  
  - Moodboards & Sourcing  
  - Spatial Strategy  

  > “Society 5IVE captured exactly what we wanted our clients to feel when they walk in.”
