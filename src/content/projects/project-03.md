  ## City Soul, Clean Lines  
  This bachelor loft was all brick and concrete — our job was to bring softness without losing edge.

  Through bold furniture choices, layered lighting, and textured rugs, we transformed this cold space into a refined, masculine retreat.

  ## What We Did  
  - Interior Styling  
  - Lighting Plan  
  - Furniture & Art Curation
