  ## Creative Space for a Growing Team  
  Bloom Co. came to us with a blank slate and bold ideas. We brought their brand to life through curved dividers, custom desks, and intentional zones that foster collaboration.

  Color theory and biophilic design helped reduce stress and encourage flow throughout the space.

  ## What We Did  
  - Brand-Aligned Commercial Design  
  - Custom Fabrication Oversight  
  - End-to-End Project Management  

  > “The space is *so* us. Clients and team members love it.”
